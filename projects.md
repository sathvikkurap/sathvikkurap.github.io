## DuckDB Snowflake Extension
**Open-source extension enabling direct data access from Snowflake to DuckDB**

The DuckDB Snowflake Extension is a community-contributed plugin for the DuckDB OLAP database that allows seamless integration with Snowflake data warehouses. This extension has garnered over 100,000 total downloads, with a peak of 16,000 weekly downloads.

**Key Features:**
- Direct Data Access: Enables ATTACH and query Snowflake data as if it were local to DuckDB
- Efficient Transfer: Utilizes Apache Arrow and ADBC for high-performance columnar data transfer
- Custom Catalog: Implements a custom catalog to integrate smoothly with DuckDB's core architecture

**Technologies Used:** C++, Apache Arrow, DuckDB, Snowflake
