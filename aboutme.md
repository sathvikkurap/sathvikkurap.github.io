subtitle: 16-Year-Old Entrepreneur & Software Engineer at University of Washington
---

I'm Sathvik Kurapati, a 16-year-old prodigy and aspiring entrepreneur pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington after entering college three years early at age 15. As a Dean's List student, I've built expertise in distributed systems, AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing while launching my entrepreneurial ventures.

My journey as a founder started with co-founding Soundwave, an AI speech processing platform that secured a $150k Letter of Intent through the prestigious TYE Global Pitch Competition at Microsoft. I'm driven to create impactful companies that solve real-world problems, and I'm thrilled to join Microsoft in June 2026 as a Business Copilot Engineer, contributing to next-generation AI solutions.

With hands-on experience in open-source (100k+ downloads on DuckDB Snowflake Extension), satellite engineering under a $265k DoD contract, cryptography research under Dr. Neal Koblitz, and leading robotics competitions, I combine technical innovation with entrepreneurial vision. My goal is to build and scale transformative startups that push the boundaries of technology.
